I USED THIS IN GARUDA LINUX / ARCH LINUX =>
    
    Let's start =>

        >check which drive has linux install by using 'ls' command
        >ls (drive name)
        >set prefix=(drive name)/@/boot/grub
        >insmod normal
        >normal

If this not work you can use following commands =>

        >check which drive has linux install by using 'ls' command
        >ls (drive name)
        >set prefix=(drive name)/boot/grub
        >insmod normal
        >normal



NOW YOUR GRUB WILL BE RESCUED


    This is not permanent we have do more

    
    You will be get boot in linux 
    now open terminal in root mode
    and input following commands=>        

        >grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
        >grub-install /dev/sda
                    or
        >grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        >grub2-install /dev/sda

After this grub will completely fixed.

    
    THANKS!
